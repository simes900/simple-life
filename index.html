My name is John and living the simple life saved my life 
I used to be a pack rat. I had so many things that I thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much. 
Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship. 

How I turned things around 
I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything. I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.
It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked. 
Now I live the simple life 
Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy. With how much it turned my life around, I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it, and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!
